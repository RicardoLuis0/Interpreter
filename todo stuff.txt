DONE

any type = runtime type checking, can generate runtime errors

unsigned int type

char type

unsigned char type

'type' type = for runtime type checking, together with "type get_type(any)" function and type literals (still unsure of type literals syntax)

TODO

auto type = parse-time type checking, generates all errors before code is executed

const types = same as regular types but without assignment operator
