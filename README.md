#Interpreter

This is my project for university.

Interpreter for a language inspired by java and c++, every value is allocated on the heap. Classes and structs are still WIP. 
Examples included in the `/examples` folder. You can execute scripts by passing them as a parameter, scripts don't accept arguments for now.
Debugging mode is planned but not implemented yet.
