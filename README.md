# Interpreter

This is my project for university.

Interpreter for a language inspired by java and c++, every value is allocated on the heap like java, but passed by value. Classes and structs are still WIP.

Examples included in the `/examples` folder. You can execute scripts by passing them as a parameter, scripts don't accept arguments for now.

Debugging mode is planned but not implemented yet.

## Features

* C-like syntax;
  * C++ style references ( using `&` );
  * Java style arrays ( on the type and not on the variable, ex. `int[20] a;` );
* Nested Functions;
* File Access ( read/write );
* Text Formatting;
* Variable dumping;
